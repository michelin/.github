# ✨ Welcome to Michelin's Open Source GitHub! 🤖

We’re committed to Open Source and actively contribute to it, welcoming external contributions and collaborations on our FOSS projects. Each of our projects serves as a collaborative platform where developers and innovators can experiment, contribute, and strengthen solutions that make an impact. Together, we are creating technologies that are more adaptable and sustainable, designed to solve real-world challenges. We also contribute to projects hosted in well-known foundations: the CNCF ☁️ , the Eclipse Foundation 🌙, and the Apache Software Foundation 🪶.

Our Open Source environment is a safe space for contributions: ensuring that everyone can engage securely and transparently.<br/>
To start contributing, check the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file in each project for detailed guidelines and visit Michelin Open Source 🌐 to learn about our commitment🤝, upcoming initiatives 🗓️, and to contact us 📨.
